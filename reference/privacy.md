# privacy

the [[cyberlink]] is private — who linked what is never disclosed. individual linking decisions are protected because surveillance kills the freedom to link.

the [[cybergraph]] is public — it is the aggregate. [[axons]] (total weight between particle pairs), [[neuron]] summaries (total focus, karma), [[particle]] energy, [[token]] supplies, π distribution — all derived from cyberlinks but revealing no individual contribution.

the [[mutator set]] provides: private ownership, unlinkable transactions, no trusted parties, and logarithmic verification — simultaneously.

the tri-kernel operates on axons — aggregate weights — not individual cyberlinks. the effective adjacency A^eff_{pq} sums contributions from many neurons. no individual contribution is visible. enough transparency for [[consensus]], enough privacy for participation.

## mutator set architecture

replaces both UTXO commitment polynomials and nullifier sets with two linked structures.

### AOCL — Append-Only Commitment List

an MMR (Merkle Mountain Range) storing addition records:

```
addition record for UTXO u:
  ar = H_commit(u.particle ‖ u.value ‖ u.owner ‖ u.nonce ‖ ρ)

  where ρ is hiding randomness contributed by the recipient

properties:
  - appended when a UTXO is created. never modified.
  - MMR structure: forest of perfect binary trees
  - peaks = O(log N) hash digests (each 32 bytes)
  - membership proof: Merkle path from leaf to peak, O(log N) hashes
  - append cost: O(1) amortized (merge adjacent equal-height peaks)
```

### SWBF — Sliding-Window Bloom Filter

tracks which UTXOs have been spent by setting pseudorandom bit positions:

```
removal record for UTXO u (with AOCL index l, randomness ρ):
  bit_indices = derive_indices(H_nullifier(u ‖ l ‖ ρ))

spending u:
  1. compute bit_indices from (u, l, ρ)
  2. for each index in active window: set the bit
  3. for each index in inactive window: provide MMR membership proof
  4. provide ZK proof that indices were correctly derived from a valid AOCL entry

double-spend prevention:
  second spend attempt → all bits already set → verifier rejects

unlinkability:
  addition record: H_commit(record ‖ ρ) — hash commitment
  removal record: bit positions in Bloom filter
  these share ZERO structural similarity visible to any observer
```

### sliding window

```
◄──── Inactive (compacted in MMR) ────►◄── Active Window ──►

┌──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐  ┌──────────────────────────┐
│chunk₀│chunk₁│chunk₂│chunk₃│  │   2²⁰ bits (128 KB)     │
│(MMR) │(MMR) │(MMR) │(MMR) │  │   directly accessible    │
└──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘  └──────────────────────────┘

window slides forward periodically.
oldest active chunk → compacted into MMR.
growth: O(log N) peaks regardless of chain age.
```

## record model

```
Record:
  particle: F_p⁴    32 bytes   content identifier
  value:    u64       8 bytes   energy amount
  owner:    F_p⁴    32 bytes   owner public key hash
  nonce:    F_p       8 bytes   random for uniqueness

commitment(r, ρ) = H_commit(r.particle ‖ r.value ‖ r.owner ‖ r.nonce ‖ ρ)
```

## proof maintenance

every UTXO holder keeps proofs synchronized as the mutator set evolves:

```
new UTXO created:     AOCL path may need update, O(log N) hashes, O(1) expected/block
old UTXO spent:       SWBF MMR proofs may need update, O(log N) average
window slides:        new MMR path if your bits were in compacted chunk, periodic

total user cost:
  average: O(log L · log N) per UTXO lifetime
  for 10⁹ users, 10-year UTXO: ~50 hemera calls per block
  ~50 × 736 = ~37,000 constraints per block for maintenance
```
